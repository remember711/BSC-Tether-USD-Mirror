# Hybrid Price Stabilization Mechanism

## Overview

The protocol utilizes a dual-layer approach to maintain price stability:

1. **Synthetic Liquidity Base**
   - Algorithmic market depth simulation
   - Price anchoring at $1.00
   - Automated volatility damping

2. **Real Liquidity Enhancement**
   - Actual asset backing
   - Liquidity pool integration
   - Dynamic reserve adjustments

## Stabilization Process

1. **Base Stability** - Algorithm maintains 850M USDT liquidity floor
2. **Real Enhancement** - Additional assets boost confidence and value
3. **Market Response** - Protocol adapts to trading patterns

## Research Directions

- Decentralized liquidity control
- Cross-chain reserve proofs
- Automated parameter optimization
